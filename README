Programmer,

Reviewer 1: The application runs as intended. I like the Vandal color scheme and the borders on each window, but if I was viewing this as a professional business card I would like to see the background a lighter color than the text to be easier on the eyes. I like the navigation by button as opposed to navigation by tabs, but the facebook function resulted in errors on every emulator I tried. The information adjusts automatically to display the same on iPhone 6, iPad, and Samsung.
